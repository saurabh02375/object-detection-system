Object Detection System
Overview
This project is an Object Detection System built using Gradio and Flask. The system allows users to upload an image or provide a video feed, and it detects and labels objects within the media. Gradio is used to create a user-friendly interface, while Flask is used to handle the backend processes and deployment.

Features
Real-time Object Detection: Detect objects in real-time using your webcam or upload an image for analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: The system includes an intuitive web interface built with Gradio, making it easy to interact with the object detection model.
Backend Powered by Flask: The application uses Flask as a lightweight web framework for handling requests and integrating the object detection model.
Customizable Model: The object detection model can be customized or replaced based on the use case.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Pip (Python package installer)
Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
Usage
Gradio Interface: Upload an image or video, and the model will process it, displaying the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
Flask Interface: Similar functionality, but the Flask version may have a different interface or additional endpoints for API integration.
